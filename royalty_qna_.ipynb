ABANDONED PROPERTY 7.1 The Grantee acknowledges that the Grantor is not obligated to maintain in good standing, renew or otherwise retain an interest in the Property and that the Grantor may, in its sole discretion, without penalty, abandon or allow to lapse any or all parts of the Property, without further obligation to the Grantee. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Grantor decides to drop or abandon any part of the Property (the “Abandoned Property ”), the Grantor shall make a written offer to Transfer title of the Abandoned Property to the Grantee free and clear of any liens. The Grantee shall respond to the offer, in writing, within ten (10) days of receiving the offer from the Grantor. 7 | P a g e 7.2 In the event that the Grantee accepts the offer to Transfer title, at the time of Transfer, the Abandoned Property shall have at least 12 months’ good standing with respect to any assessment work and all fees or taxes shall be current. Any shortfall in the 12 months’ assessment work requirement, shall be remedied by the Grantor either 1) making a “payment in place” on the Abandoned Property; 2) transferring available assessment credits from contiguous Property; or 3) making a cash payment to the Grantee along with the Transfer, equal to one and one-half (1 ½) times the annual assessment work requirement on the Abandoned Property. 7.3 In the event that the Grantee declines the offer of Transfer of title, the Grantor may abandon the Property with no further action necessary. At any time, should the Grantor re-stake or reacquire the Abandoned Property, such Property shall once again form part of the Royalty and made subject to the provisions of this Agreement. 8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 8.1 All information, data, reports, records, feasibility studies, agreements, assays, test results, analyses and calculations relating to the Property, the Products, the activities of the Grantor in respect of the Property, or the Products or pursuant to this Agreement, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of which is in this Section referred to as \" Confidential Information \", will be treated by the Grantee as confidential and will not be disclosed to any person except as expressly permitted in\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Royalty Rates**:\n",
            "   - \"Royalty\" means two percent (2%) of Net Returns from the Property identified as an “Exiro Staked Claim” in Schedule “A” and one percent (1%) of Net Returns from the Property identified as a “Voyageur Claim” in Schedule “A” (Source: Definition of \"Royalty\").\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Partial Purchase Option**:\n",
            "   - The Grantor has the option to re-purchase a portion of the Royalty equal to one percent (1%) of Net Returns from the “Exiro Staked Claims” and one half of one percent (0.5%) from the “Voyageur Claims” for a price equal to $1,000,000 (Source: Section 5.1).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Payment Terms**:\n",
            "   - The Royalty shall be due and payable within fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar quarter (Source: Section 6(a)).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Audit and Objection Rights**:\n",
            "   - The Grantee has the right to inspect books and records and to object to the Royalty calculation within ninety (90) days after receipt of the statement (Source: Section 6(c) and 6(d)).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Transfer Rights**:\n",
            "   - Both the Grantee and the Grantor have rights to transfer the Royalty under certain conditions, with a requirement of thirty (30) days' advance notice (Source: Section 4.1 and 4.2).\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Abandonment and Re-staking**:\n",
            "   - The Grantor can abandon the Property but must offer the Grantee the option to take over the title. If the Grantee declines, the Grantor can abandon without further obligation. If re-staked, the Property becomes part of the Royalty again (Source: Section 7.1 and 7.3).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Confidentiality**:\n",
            "   - All information related to the Property and the Agreement is to be treated as confidential (Source: Section 8.1).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Analysis**:\n",
            "- The royalty rates of 2% and 1% are fairly standard in the mining industry, depending on the profitability and risk associated with the specific mining project.\n",
            "- The option for the Grantor to buy back a portion of the Royalty for $1,000,000 provides flexibility but could reduce the Grantee's long-term income if exercised.\n",
            "- The payment terms and audit rights provide the Grantee with regular income and oversight capabilities.\n",
            "- The transfer rights allow both parties to monetize or adjust their positions, which can be advantageous.\n",
            "- The abandonment clause allows the Grantor to manage its portfolio without penalty, but the Grantee has a chance to take over the Property.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion**:\n",
            "This royalty deal appears to be balanced, offering both parties flexibility and protection. The rates and terms are typical for the industry, and the buy-back option provides a potential exit strategy for the Grantor. The deal's attractiveness ultimately depends on the specific economic potential of the mining claims involved.\n",

            "Answer:\n",
            " To identify potential red flags in the mining royalty contract, we need to carefully examine the terms and conditions outlined in the excerpts provided. Here are some potential red flags or areas of concern:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Partial Purchase of Royalty**: \n",
            "   - The Grantor has the right to re-purchase a portion of the Royalty for a set price. This could be a red flag if the Grantee is relying on the full royalty for revenue. The specific terms are: \"the Grantor shall have, in its sole discretion, the right and option to re-purchase a portion of the Royalty equal to one percent (1%) of Net Returns from the “Exiro Staked Claims” in Schedule “A” and one half of one percent (0.5%) from the “Voyageur Claims” in Schedule “A” for a price equal to $1,000,000 (the \"Reduction Price\").\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Abandonment of Property**:\n",
            "   - The Grantor can abandon the property without penalty, which could affect the Grantee's interests: \"the Grantor may, in its sole discretion, without penalty, abandon or allow to lapse any or all parts of the Property, without further obligation to the Grantee.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Underlying Royalty and Buy-back Right**:\n",
            "   - The Voyageur Claims are subject to an underlying royalty with a buy-back option, which could complicate the financial structure: \"The six (6) claims identified as a “Voyageur Claim” in Schedule “A” are subject to an underlying Purchase agreement...whereby these third parties collectively hold a 1% NSR Royalty that is subject to a buy-back right whereby EXIRO may reduce this royalty to a 0.5% NSR royalty for a payment of $750,000.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Confidential Information**:\n",
            "   - The Grantee is allowed to disclose confidential information to various parties, which could be a concern if not properly managed: \"The Grantee may disclose Confidential Information: (a) to its auditors, legal counsel, institutional lenders, brokers, underwriters and investment bankers...\"\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Dispute Resolution**:\n",
            "   - The arbitration process could be lengthy or costly, depending on the specifics of Schedule “C”: \"All disputes...may at the any time thereafter, be submitted to arbitration by written demand of either Party, in accordance with the procedures outlined in Schedule “C”.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "These points highlight areas where the Grantee should exercise caution and possibly seek further clarification or legal advice to ensure their interests are adequately protected.\n"
